I utilize PowerShell to help automate some processes that benefit both my team and I.
All downloadable scripts are saved as text files. Please see a few examples below:

The scripts listed below utilize the Invoke-WebRequest and Invoke-RestMethod cmdlets to allow webscraping and REST API requests.
These requests cannot be tested as the internal website that I wrote these scripts for requires authentication.

<b>Webscrape-RM-PS</b> - Connects to a specified webpage and pulls the innertext of a specified HTML element.
Feel free to download this script here.

<b>Webscrape-RM-API</b> - Makes two API calls to pull data directly from the SQL database that powers our internal website.
Feel free to download this script here.

<b>Webscrape-TransferRecords</b> Makes an API call to pull asset transfer history from our SQL database.
Feel free to download this script here.

<b>Webscrape-Post-TSO</b> This script makes a REST API POST request to push data to our internal SQL database.
This script still does not work correctly, but it serves as a great example for building POST requests bodies, making REST API POST requests, and pulling request verification tokens (XSRF tokens).
If you feel comfortable making such requests, please feel free to contact me. I would love to work with you to get a similar request to work.
